/**
 * @file
 * Atomic memory access operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * In a multithread context, memory content can be seen differently between threads.<br>
 * A thread can have written at an address but others threads could still read the old value.<br>
 * This can be due to aggressive optimizations (Instructions re-ordering) or the presence of several processors caches.<br>
 * To prevent this issue memory barriers must be used. There are two types or memory barriers:<br>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Software memory barriers for compiler re-ordering.</li>
 * <li>Hardware memory barriers for processor (Fence).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Beware that variables for these functions must be aligned!
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Compilers provide built-in functions that implements barriers.<br>
 * For atomic operations, barriers that are both hardware and software must be used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In case of undefined reference to __syncXXXX error, add -march=i486 to compiler option.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * While compiling for 32 bits processor, __syncXXXX obviously does not support atomic operations on 64 bits.<br>
 * As a consequence RT_ATOMIC_LOAD64 and so on cannot exist.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It has no associated .c file.
 * </p>
